***Instructions to run the Node.js server***

- Ensure that Node.js is installed
- Open up console in root directory
- Navigate to index.js
- Run node index.js and keep window open to continue running server

- Navigate to localhost:8000 to see hosted webpage
- As long as the server is running, the webpage should be displayed without any need to change files.

***NOTES***

- Projection Graph is not functional, so button press does not call any functions
- If graphs take time to display, be patient and give the server time to collect all data from the OpenTSDB instance.
- The Sunburst graph is a demonstration and does not use data from the database.
